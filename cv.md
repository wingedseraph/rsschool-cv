## About me

I went through a very strange path after school I wanted to enter the film director, but life made a turn and now I ended up in applied computer science at the university and now I just want to develop more and more in this direction.

## Skills

- HTML (basic knowledge)
- CSS (basic knowledge)
- JavaScript (basic knowledge)
- Version control: Git (remote service GitHub)
- C++ (basic knowledge), Python (basic knowledge)
- Linux, MacOS, Windows OS
- Editors: Neovim, VSCode

## Code Example

```JavaScript
// Use single quotes for string literals
const greeting = "Hello, world";

// Use camel case for variable and function names
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(greeting + " " + name);
}

// Use const or let for variable declarations instead of var
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"];

// Use arrow functions for concise function declarations
names.forEach((name) => {
  sayHello(name);
});

// Use template literals for string interpolation
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 5;
console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${num1 + num2}`);
```
